"""Shared Pydantic models for the evaluation sub-package.

These models define the contracts used by all evaluation components:
scorers, aggregator, regression checker, sampling, and the top-level evaluator.

CaseResult.tier uses a plain string ("critical", "normal", "low") rather than
importing PriorityTier from the dataset sub-package to avoid cross-package
dependency issues during parallel Wave 1 execution.
