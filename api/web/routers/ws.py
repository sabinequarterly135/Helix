"""WebSocket endpoints for evolution and synthesis event streaming.

Provides real-time event streaming with reconnection replay support.
Protocol:
1. Server sends {"type": "connected", "run_id": X}
2. Client sends {"type": "subscribe", "last_event_id": N}
3. Server replays missed events (event_id > N) from ring buffer
4. Server streams live events until terminal event

Routes:
    WS /ws/evolution/{run_id}   Connect to evolution event stream
    WS /ws/synthesis/{run_id}   Connect to synthesis event stream
