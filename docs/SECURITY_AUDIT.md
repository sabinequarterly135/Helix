# Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Scope:** Full git history scan for secrets, PII, and sensitive data
**Purpose:** Verify repository is safe for public open-source release
**Auditor:** Automated scan + manual review

## Methodology

The following checks were performed against the complete git history (all branches) of the Helix repository:

1. **Environment file scan** -- Searched for any `.env`, `*.env`, or `.env.*` files ever added to version control using `git log --all --diff-filter=A`.
2. **API key pattern scan** -- Searched full git diff history for patterns matching `api_key`, `secret_key`, `password`, `token`, and `bearer` followed by string assignments. Excluded known test values.
3. **Provider-specific key scan** -- Searched for provider-specific key formats: OpenAI (`sk-`), Google (`AIza`), and GitHub (`ghp_`) token patterns.
4. **Database file scan** -- Checked for any `.db`, `.sqlite`, or `.sqlite3` files ever committed.
5. **Credential file scan** -- Checked for `credentials*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.cert`, `*.p12` files ever committed.
6. **Hardcoded secrets scan** -- Searched current codebase (`src/` and `tests/`) for `api_key = "<value>"` patterns, excluding test fixtures.
7. **PII scan** -- Searched for real email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses in test fixtures and source code.
8. **`.gitignore` coverage audit** -- Verified all sensitive file patterns are covered.

## Findings

| # | Check | Result | Details |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `.env` files in history | **PASS** | Only `.env.example` was ever committed (intentional template). No `.env` or `.env.*` files with real values found. |
| 2 | API key patterns in history | **PASS** | All matches are test fixtures using obvious placeholder values: `test-key`, `test-gemini-key`, `test-key-abcd1234`, `or-key-wxyz5678`, `constructor-key`. No real API keys detected. |
| 3 | Provider-specific keys (sk-, AIza, ghp_) | **PASS** | No matches found. No OpenAI, Google, or GitHub tokens ever committed. |
| 4 | Database files in history | **PASS** | No `.db`, `.sqlite`, or `.sqlite3` files ever committed. |
| 5 | Credential files in history | **PASS** | No `credentials*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.cert`, or `*.p12` files ever committed. |
| 6 | Hardcoded secrets in current code | **PASS** | All `api_key` assignments in `src/` and `tests/` use obvious test values (e.g., `test-key`, `test-gemini-key`). No real credentials found. |
| 7 | PII in test fixtures | **PASS** | No real email addresses, phone numbers, or physical addresses found in test data or source code. |
| 8 | `.gitignore` coverage | **UPDATED** | Several gaps found and fixed (see below). |

### Test Key Inventory

The following test keys exist in test files and are confirmed safe (not real credentials):

| File | Value | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `tests/config/test_models.py` | `test-key`, `constructor-key`, `test-gemini-key` | Config loading tests |
| `tests/api/test_settings.py` | `test-key-abcd1234`, `or-key-wxyz5678` | Settings API tests |
| `tests/coldstart/test_importer.py` | `test-key` | Importer tests |
| `tests/gateway/test_protocol.py` | `test-key` | Provider protocol tests |

These follow a clear naming convention (`test-*`, `*-key`) and do not match any real provider key format.

## .gitignore Updates

The following patterns were **added** to `.gitignore` during this audit:

| Pattern | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `*.sqlite` | Database files (`.db` was covered, but `.sqlite` was not) |
| `*.sqlite3` | Database files (alternative extension) |
| `.env.*` | Environment file variants (`.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc.) |
| `!.env.example` | Exclude `.env.example` from the `.env.*` rule (template file, safe to commit) |
| `*.pem` | SSL/TLS certificate files |
| `*.key` | Private key files |
| `*.cert` | Certificate files |
| `*.p12` | PKCS#12 certificate archives |
| `node_modules/` | Node.js dependencies (was in `frontend/.gitignore` but not root) |

**Previously covered patterns** (already present, no changes needed):
- `.env` -- environment secrets
- `gene.yaml` -- YAML config (may contain keys)
- `*.db` -- SQLite databases
- `__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]` -- Python bytecode
- `.venv/`, `venv/`, `env/` -- virtual environments
- `dist/`, `build/` -- build output
- `.claude/` -- Claude Code config

## Recommendations

### Before Making Public

1. **No history rewrite needed.** No real secrets, API keys, or PII were found in the git history. The repository is clean.

2. **Rotate any keys used during development.** Even though no keys were committed, as a best practice, rotate all API keys (Gemini, OpenRouter, OpenAI) that were used during development before making the repository public.

3. **Verify `.env.example` values.** The `.env.example` file contains only placeholder values (`your-gemini-api-key-here`) and is safe to include in the public repository.

### Ongoing Secret Hygiene

1. **Pre-commit hook (recommended).** Consider adding a pre-commit hook using a tool like [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) or [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) to prevent accidental secret commits.

2. **CI secret scanning.** Enable GitHub's built-in secret scanning (available for public repositories) after making the repo public.

3. **Contributor guidelines.** The CONTRIBUTING.md should remind contributors to never commit real API keys and to use `.env` for local configuration.

4. **Test key convention.** Maintain the existing convention of using `test-*` prefixed keys in test files. This makes auditing straightforward.

## Conclusion

**VERDICT: SAFE TO MAKE PUBLIC**

The Helix repository has a clean git history with no secrets, API keys, PII, or sensitive data ever committed. All API key references in the codebase are test fixtures with obvious placeholder values. The `.gitignore` has been updated to cover additional sensitive file patterns. No history rewrite (BFG Repo Cleaner or git filter-repo) is required.
